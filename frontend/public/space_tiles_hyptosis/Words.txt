These were originally made for my personal minecraft server, however I think they could be used in
other projects.

Thanks, hope these art assets are useful to you! Feel free to use or edit them however you want, for
free games, for paid games, whatever just go and create something great! And please don't release my
assets for money unless they're in your game!!! You can give me credit if you want, but you're not
required to, although I'd appreciate it! -Hyptosis
